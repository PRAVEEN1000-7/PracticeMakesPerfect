# Day 7 - Mini Project

*Simple Calculator*

## Project Completed âœ…
16. **Simple Calculator** - Supports +, -, *, /; handles division by zero

## What I Learned
- User menu design and interface
- Loop structures for continuous operation (`while True`)
- Input validation and error handling
- Match-case statements (Python 3.10+)
- Division by zero exception handling
- String formatting with f-strings
- Text centering and formatting
- Program flow control with `break`
- Multiple condition checking

## Key Features Implemented
- Interactive menu system
- Four basic mathematical operations
- Division by zero error handling
- Continuous operation until user exits
- Clean output formatting
- Input validation

## Code Structure
```python
# Menu-driven calculator with error handling
while True:
    # Display menu
    # Get user choice
    # Perform operation with match-case
    # Handle division by zero
    # Display results
    # Exit condition
```
