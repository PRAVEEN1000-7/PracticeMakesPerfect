# Day 3 - Conditionals

*Conditionals*

## Problems Completed âœ…
6. **Largest of Three** - Find the largest number without using max()
7. **Leap Year** - Check if a year is a leap year

## What I Learned
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Complex condition checking
- Nested conditionals for multi-step logic

## Files
- `LargestFromThree.py`
