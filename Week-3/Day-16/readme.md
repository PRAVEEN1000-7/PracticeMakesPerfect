# Day 15-16 - Classes & Objects
*Classes & Objects* | *Algorithm Problem Solving*

## Problems Completed âœ…
- **Dog Class** - Create a Dog class with attributes (name, age) and methods (bark(), get_age())
- **Bank Account Class** - Implement a BankAccount class with deposit, withdraw, and balance check
- **String Representation Methods** - Add __str__ and __repr__ methods
- **Pascal's Triangle** - Generate first numRows of Pascal's triangle

## What I Learned
- String representation methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`)
- User-friendly vs developer-friendly object display
- Financial transaction modeling
- Dynamic programming concepts
- 2D list/matrix manipulation
- Mathematical pattern recognition
- Edge case handling (triangle boundaries)
- Class-based solution structure

## Solution Approaches Implemented
1. **Dog Class:** Basic class structure with attributes and methods
2. **Bank Account Class:** Advanced class with validation and financial operations
3. **String Representation:** Proper object display formatting
4. **Pascal's Triangle:** Dynamic programming with 2D array building

## Key Concepts
- **__str__:** User-friendly string representation for display
- **__repr__:** Developer-friendly representation for debugging
- **Input Validation:** Check amounts before processing transactions
- **State Management:** Track and update object attributes safely
- **Pascal's Triangle:** Each element = sum of two elements above it
- **Boundary Conditions:** First and last elements of each row are always 1
- **Dynamic Building:** Each row depends on the previous row

## Code Structure
```python
# Classes with validation, state management, and proper string representation
# Pascal's Triangle: Nested loops with boundary conditions
```
