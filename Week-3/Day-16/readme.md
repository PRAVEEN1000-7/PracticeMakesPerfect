# Week-End-Challenges - Week 3

*Algorithm Problem Solving*

## Challenges Completed âœ…
**Pascal's Triangle** - Generate first numRows of Pascal's triangle

## What I Learned
- Dynamic programming concepts
- 2D list/matrix manipulation
- Mathematical pattern recognition
- Edge case handling (triangle boundaries)
- Class-based solution structure

## Solution Approaches Implemented
1. **Pascal's Triangle:** Dynamic programming with 2D array building

## Key Concepts
- **Pascal's Triangle:** Each element = sum of two elements above it
- **Boundary Conditions:** First and last elements of each row are always 1
- **Dynamic Building:** Each row depends on the previous row

## Code Structure
```python
# Pascal's Triangle: Nested loops with boundary conditions
```
