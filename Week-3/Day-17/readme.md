# Week-End-Challenges - Week 3

*Algorithm Problem Solving*

## Challenges Completed âœ…
- **Day 16 - Pascal's Triangle** - Generate first numRows of Pascal's triangle
- **Day 17 - Longest Common Prefix** - Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings

## What I Learned
- String comparison algorithms
- Character-by-character iteration
- Early termination optimization
- Prefix matching techniques

## Solution Approaches Implemented
1. **Pascal's Triangle:** Dynamic programming with 2D array building
2. **Longest Common Prefix:** Character-by-character comparison with early termination

## Key Concepts
- **Longest Common Prefix:** Compare characters across all strings simultaneously
- **Early Exit:** Stop when mismatch found or string boundary reached

## Code Structure
```python
# Longest Common Prefix: Character iteration with boundary checking
```

## Files
- `PascalTriangle.py`
