# Day 17-18 - Inheritance & Polymorphism 

*Inheritance & Polymorphism* | *Algorithm Problem Solving*

## Problems Completed âœ…
- **Shape Classes** - Create a Shape base class with an area() method. Subclasses: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle
- **Longest Common Prefix** - Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings

## What I Learned
- Base class and inheritance concepts
- Abstract method implementation with `NotImplementedError`
- Method overriding in subclasses
- Polymorphism through common interface
- String comparison algorithms
- Character-by-character iteration
- Early termination optimization
- Prefix matching techniques

## Solution Approaches Implemented
1. **Shape Classes:** Base class with abstract method and concrete subclasses
2. **Longest Common Prefix:** Character-by-character comparison with early termination

## Key Concepts
- **Inheritance:** Subclasses inherit from Shape base class
- **Abstract Methods:** Base class defines interface, subclasses implement
- **Polymorphism:** Same method name (area()) with different behaviors
- **Method Overriding:** Each subclass provides its own area() calculation
- **Longest Common Prefix:** Compare characters across all strings simultaneously

## Code Structure
```python
# Inheritance: Base class with abstract method, subclasses with implementations
# Longest Common Prefix: Character iteration with boundary checking
```
