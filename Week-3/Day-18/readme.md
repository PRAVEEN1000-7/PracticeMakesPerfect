# Week-End-Challenges - Week 3

*Algorithm Problem Solving*

## Challenges Completed âœ…
- **Day 16 - Pascal's Triangle** - Generate first numRows of Pascal's triangle
- **Day 17 - Longest Common Prefix** - Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings
- **Day 18 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** - Find maximum profit from buying and selling stock once

## What I Learned
- Single-pass optimization techniques
- Tracking minimum and maximum values simultaneously
- Greedy algorithm approach
- Profit calculation and comparison
- Efficient array traversal patterns

## Solution Approaches Implemented
1. **Pascal's Triangle:** Dynamic programming with 2D array building
2. **Longest Common Prefix:** Character-by-character comparison with early termination
3. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:** Single-pass greedy algorithm with min tracking

## Key Concepts
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:** Track minimum price while calculating maximum profit
- **Greedy Approach:** Make locally optimal choice (update min price) for global optimum
- **Single Pass Efficiency:** Solve in O(n) time with O(1) space

## Code Structure
```python
# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock: Track min price and max profit in single pass
```
