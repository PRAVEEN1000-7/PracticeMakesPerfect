# Day 17-18 - Inheritance & Polymorphism

*Inheritance & Polymorphism* | *Algorithm Problem Solving*

## Problems Completed âœ…
- **Shape Classes** - Base class with subclasses: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle
- **Polymorphism Demo** - Iterate over shapes and call area()
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** - Find maximum profit from buying and selling stock once

## What I Learned
- Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
- Polymorphism and method overriding
- Super() for extending parent behavior
- Single-pass optimization techniques
- Tracking minimum and maximum values simultaneously
- Greedy algorithm approach
- Profit calculation and comparison


## Solution Approaches Implemented
1. **Shape Classes:** Abstract base class with polymorphic subclasses
2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:** Single-pass greedy algorithm with min tracking

## Key Concepts
- **Polymorphism:** Same method, different behaviors
- **Super():** Extend parent class functionality
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:** Track minimum price while calculating maximum profit
- **Single Pass Efficiency:** Solve in O(n) time with O(1) space

## Code Structure
```python
# Inheritance: ABC with polymorphic iteration over shape objects
# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock: Track min price and max profit in single pass
```
