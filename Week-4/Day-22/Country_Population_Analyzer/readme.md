# Day 22 - Virtual Environments & Pip

*Virtual Environments & Pip*

## Problems Completed âœ…
- **Virtual Environment Setup** - Create and activate a virtual environment
- **Package Installation** - Install external packages (requests, pandas)
- **Dependency Management** - Manage project dependencies with requirements.txt
- **API Data Processing** - Fetch and process country data using external libraries

## What I Learned
- Virtual environment creation and activation
- Package installation with pip
- Requirements.txt for dependency management
- External library integration (requests, pandas)
- API data fetching and JSON processing
- DataFrame operations and data manipulation
- Pipreqs for automatic requirements generation

## Solution Approaches Implemented
1. **Virtual Environment:** Isolated Python environment for project dependencies
2. **API Integration:** External data fetching with error handling and pandas processing

## Key Concepts
- **Virtual Environment:** Isolated package management with .venv
- **Requirements.txt:** Dependency tracking and version control
- **Requests Library:** HTTP requests and API interaction
- **Pandas DataFrame:** Data manipulation and sorting operations

## Code Structure
```python
# Virtual Environment: Isolated dependency management
# API Integration: Requests + Pandas for data processing
```

## Files
- `.venv/` (virtual environment)
- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `readme.md`
