# Day 14 - Mini Project

*Word Frequency Counter*

## Project Completed âœ…
33. **Word Frequency Counter** - Reads a file, counts word occurrences, outputs top 10 most frequent words

## What I Learned
- File reading and text processing
- Dictionary-based word counting
- Text splitting and tokenization
- Data sorting with custom key functions
- Lambda functions for sorting criteria
- Dictionary slicing and manipulation
- Comprehensive error handling (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError)
- Exception hierarchy and generic exception handling
- User input for file selection
- Enumeration for numbered output formatting

## Key Features Implemented
- Dynamic file input from user
- Word frequency analysis
- Top 10 most frequent words extraction
- Sorted output with ranking
- Multiple exception handling
- Clean error messages
- Professional output formatting

## Code Structure
```python
# File-based word frequency analyzer
try:
    # Get filename from user
    # Read file content
    # Count word occurrences in dictionary
    # Sort by frequency (descending)
    # Display top 10 with ranking
except Multiple Exception Types:
    # Handle various file errors gracefully
```
