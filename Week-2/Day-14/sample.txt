TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning and deep learning framework developed by Google.
It is mainly used to build, train, and deploy neural network models.
TensorFlow works efficiently on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
The core data structure in TensorFlow is the tensor, which represents multi-dimensional arrays.
It provides both low-level APIs for flexibility and high-level APIs like Keras for simplicity.
TensorFlow supports eager execution, which allows operations to run immediately.
It is widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
TensorFlow has tools for deploying models on web, mobile, and cloud platforms.
It also supports distributed training across multiple machines for scalability.
TensorFlow is one of the most popular frameworks in both research and industry.
