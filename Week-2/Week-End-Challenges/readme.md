# Week-End-Challenges - Week 2

*Algorithm Problem Solving*

## Challenge Completed ✅
**Two Sum Problem** - Find two numbers in array that add up to target, return their indices

## What I Learned
- Algorithm optimization techniques
- Time complexity analysis (O(n²) vs O(n))
- Space complexity trade-offs
- Hash map/dictionary for fast lookups
- Brute force vs optimized approaches
- Index tracking in algorithms
- Enumerate function for index-value pairs
- Algorithm problem-solving patterns
- LeetCode-style problem structure

## Solution Approaches Implemented
1. **Brute Force (O(n²))** - Nested loops to check all pairs
2. **Hash Map (O(n))** - Single pass with complement lookup

## Key Concepts
- **Brute Force:** Simple but inefficient nested loop approach
- **Hash Map:** Trade memory for speed using seen values dictionary
- **Complement Logic:** For each number, look for (target - number)
- **Early Return:** Stop when solution found

## Code Structure
```python
# Two different approaches:
# 1. Brute Force: Check all pairs
# 2. Hash Map: Store seen numbers, lookup complements
```
